Programming Interviews Exposed Ch4: Linked List Problems

This repository consists of the solutions to linked list coding problems that are inspired by Chapter 4 of the 3rd edition of Programming Interview Exposed, Secrets to Landing Your Next Job. http://a.co/d/3RBTAXg 

## Build
This projet depends on CppUTest.  You can get it from here: https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest.  Get it, buid it, make sure the libraries are linked into the root of the enlistment under xx/lib  and then create an enviornment variable called $(CPPUTEST_HOME) that points to the root of the enlistment.  From there it should build just fine.
